    "This notebook has the implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann algorithm for a fluid moving in the x-direction with periodic boundary conditions on this axis but no-slip boundary conditions in y -axis. The fluid is simulated as a  square lattice which each nodes can move in 9 different directions (d2q9 model) and the points that cross the top and bottom boundaries (y direction) are bounced back to the fluid restoring the previous position but with minus the velocity it had. The velocity in the x-direction will be constant and no object was put inside the fluid.\n",
